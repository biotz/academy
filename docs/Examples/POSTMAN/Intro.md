Postman is a popular tool used by developers to test, develop, and document APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to send HTTP requests to servers and receive responses. With Postman, you can perform various operations such as sending GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests, among others, and view the corresponding responses.

In addition to sending requests and receiving responses, Postman also offers advanced features such as saving requests, test automation, API documentation generation, and team collaboration.

In summary, Postman is a useful tool for developers working with APIs as it allows them to efficiently test and develop their APIs and collaborate with their teams.
