## Introduction

Organization administrators can invite new users to their organization. 

## Prerequisites

Only organization administrators can invite new users.

## Invite a new user

New users are created from the user list view. The list can be accessed from 'Users' in the 'Organization management' section in the sidebar menu.

</div>
There, new users can be created using the “Add new user” button.

</div>
For creating the new user only an email address is required. Upon pressing save, the web application will notify the user if the process was successful or not.

## Accept invitation

When a new user is created, a welcome email is sent.

</div>

The email contains a URL that the new user has to open when it’s ready to set up its login credentials.

</div>

Opening the URL will trigger another email to be sent.

</div>

Clicking on the second email will redirect the user to the authentication provider. There the user will have to type the password that wants to use to login into Biotz.

</div>

<div class="tutorial-image-container">
![Update Password2](/img/update-password-2.png)
</div>
And finally the user will be redirected to the login page, where it can start using Biotz.
