# Account registration


Please not that In order to complete this tutorial you will need a valid email address.

First navigate to the [Biotz Cloud](https://auth.biotz.io/realms/biotz-platform/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=biotz-platform-spa&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.biotz.io%2Foverview&state=9821fae0-b8ea-4b9f-b7f2-ebe9ad3c482c&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=2063c301-fb70-4d7e-81f0-5790cefcf23f&ui_locales=en&code_challenge=bj-DokiKe4Pu4Xfta9-fhtiK1qjA8--GqPnUwWXfv1Y&code_challenge_method=S256). Once here you will be presented with the login page:

<div class="tutorial-image-container">
    ![sign-in](/img/SignIn.png)
</div>

Since you do not have an account yet, hit the **Register** link at the bottom, below the **Sign In** button. This will lead you to the registration page.

<div class="tutorial-image-container">
    ![New Device2](/img/Register.png)
</div>

As can be seen in the image above, the registration form asks for just your **Email** address and a **Password**. Once you have entered that information, hit **Register** and you will be prompted to accept the **Terms and Conditions** of Biotz. By accepting them, an email will be sent to you to verify your email address and activate your account.

<div class="tutorial-image-container">
    ![Verifying](/img/Verifying.png)
</div>

In case you didnâ€™t receive an email, you can try sending it again by clicking on the **Click here to resend the email** link.

# Verifying email account

The email you received will have a verification link that you have to use before the advertised expiration time to successfully validate your email address.

By navigating to the verification link you will see the following page:

<div class="tutorial-image-container">
    ![Confirm](/img/Confirm.png)
</div>

Just click on the link below **Click here to proceed** and you will have verified your email account.

# Creating your organisation

After verifying your email address you are ready to login into Biotz. Go back to the login page at Biotz Cloud, introduce your login credentials and hit **Sign In**. Next, you will be presented with the following page:

<div class="tutorial-image-container">
    ![Organisation](/img/organisation.png)
</div>

In order to finish the creation of your account you need to create an **Organisation**. The creation form asks for three things: the **Country**, **Legal name** and the **Tax ID** of your organisation. If you have done everything correctly you will see the **Overview page and your registration process will be finished.
