The process involves a systematic sequence of 7 steps that entail configuring Biotz\'s core components. Through these steps, you\'ll initiate the transmission and ingestion of data. Notably, this tutorial eliminates the necessity for a physical device to complete the procedures; all tasks associated with data transmission and ingestion will be simulated, fostering an accessible and hands-on learning experience.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 1 - Creating a Device Type":{"id":"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 1 - Creating a Device Type","title":"Creating a Device Type","description":"Before we start sending and ingesting data you have to configure your Biotz account to be able to know who is sending data and how to process it. The first step is to create a Device Type, which will allow you to categorise your devices. Assuming you have signed in into the application, from the sidebar, in the Setup section, click on Device Type.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 2 - Creating a Message Type":{"id":"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 2 - Creating a Message Type","title":"Creating a Message Type","description":"As the name implies this is a type of message your device can send. If your device outputs different information structures, each of them would be a different Message Type. In this tutorial, you will create a single Message Type for the sake of simplicity. To do so, from the sidebar, in the Setup section, click on Data Ingestion Flow. You will be presented with the following page:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 3 - Creating a Schema":{"id":"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 3 - Creating a Schema","title":"Creating a Schema","description":"Now that you have created a Message Type, you have to define the shape of the data for that Message Type. This is what is called Schemas in Biotz. Schemas are just the definition of the structure of what your device will send to the platform. This helps Biotz ingest and process your data effectively.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 4 - Creating  a device":{"id":"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 4 - Creating  a device","title":"Creating a device","description":"Before sending any data you need to register a device. To do so, from the sidebar, in the Device Management section, click on Devices. This will show up a list of devices. In the top right corner you click on New device. You will see the following form:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 5 - Authenticating  a device":{"id":"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 5 - Authenticating  a device","title":"Authenticating a device","description":"In this tutorial, as said in the beginning, the data sending will be simulated. To do so, you will make an HTTP request to the http-forwarder service of Biotz which will, as the name implies, forward your data ingestion request to the competent services. That is the reason why you chose the HTTP communication protocol before when creating a message type.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 6 - Sending a data ingestion request":{"id":"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 6 - Sending a data ingestion request","title":"Sending a data ingestion request","description":"Now that you have a token from Biotz Identity Provider, it is time to send actual data to Biotz. In this tutorial, as said before, you will simulate a device sending data using the terminal. The approach is basically the same as to retrieve a token, just an HTTP request to the http-forwarder service. It will take your request and re-route it into a queue to be processed when the system is available.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 7 - Displaying the data":{"id":"Tutorials/Getting started/Step 7 - Displaying the data","title":"Displaying the data","description":"In order to display the data you will need to create a dashboard and a panel. A dashboard is a collection of panels. Each panel contains a specific query to display your data. You can also apply different customizations to the panel\'s appearance. However, the focus of this tutorial is to just display your newly ingested data. Bear in mind that the data you will display is a single point, if you have followed this tutorial. Displaying a single point is not very useful but the end goal is to learn how it works. So, later on when you create your real dashboard panels you have a good foundation to do so.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
